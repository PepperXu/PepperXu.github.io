Vibeke and Lansing have been co-teaching in two ADM courses, The Aesthetics, and The Guided Study of Advanced Interdisciplinary Research in Media. They were the most down-to-the-earth and beautiful human beings I have met in school. Now they will be travelling to California and start the next part of theIR journey at Stanford University. All the best!
