### My role
Character Artist and animation

### Duration
48 hours

By the time I walked into the main hall of the Shanghai GameJam, I was still not sure whether we had the ability to create a game in such a short time. For me, I also had to choose from playing the role of a programmer or an artist. Half of the people in my team were complete stranger to me. It all depends on how we were going to collaborate.

The title was set as “campfire”. We decided to go for a “plot-driven” game. By the time we were greatly inspired by a niche trick for narrative in some traditional point and click RPG games, and that is you complete the story by playing the game multiple times until you collect all the items or endings.

Since our leader said he could handle all the coding, I was given the “freedom” of completely focusing on art creation, a brand new territory for me.

In the design process of the main character, our opinion differed on how the game should look like. While I tried to make it look more like oil-painting or watercolour, the others suggested keeping it simple. I eventually conformed to this decision. We didn’t really have time and experience to manage all the complex type, especially in animation. In fact, even these simple drawings took me the entire 48 hours without sleeping.

Talking about animation, it was another new world to me. I was using Photoshop doing this since that was the one I was familiar with, and my workflow was horribly inefficient. But I was really having lots of fun messing around the settings I never had touched before.

The game made itself to the finalist. Although unfortunately we didn’t win any awards (I absolutely think we should at least win the best student game), we all truly enjoyed the competition, and the hot pot afterwards!
