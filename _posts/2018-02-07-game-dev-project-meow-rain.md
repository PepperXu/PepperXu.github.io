### My Role
Designer, Programmer

### Duration
One month

Experimenting with Unity’s multiplayer system. The project was developed for a course assignment in four weeks. It turned out that my team was the only group that implemented the multiplayer feature (which was not a requirement) and that really surprised our prof.  

It’s my pleasure to work with Huang Xinwei, who has her own unique art style and perception and is a great team player and cat lover. All the best to the future!
