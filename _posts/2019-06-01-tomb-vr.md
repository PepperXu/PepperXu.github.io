I collaborated with Pham Duc Thang and Trinh Tuan Dung in this VR game development project. This is also the FYP project for Thang, who is a very talented 2D and 3D artist. Being the senior of me in the same major (Information Engineering and Media), he showed great passion and diligence in learning digital art on his own, while this was not the major focus of our school requirements. His enthusiasm was really inspiring to me.

In this project, I am mostly in charge of the development of game mechanics and artificial intelligence (AI) agents. The major challenge was to develop the interaction and environment that are suitably scaled to a virtual reality user experience. And this has become my very first concern when we started with the project.

The game was made in Unreal Engine 4.

### Locomotion

Virtual Reality sickness is the major problem that prevents many users from enjoying the content. Motion sickness is the most common type of VR sickness. It is sometimes due to the conflict of visual movement and physical movement sensed by the ear. A low frame rate on screen or a low resolution of animation can also cause sickness. To mitigate the problem, several movement methods that would not induce motion sickness were tested.

Physical walking is suitable for a room-sized game, where the dimension of the game level matches the physical environment. This is not the case in our game with an open-space setting.

Teleport moves the player instantly to any walkable surface in the virtual world within a certain radius. This is not particularly applicable for the stealth element in our game, because players should deal with the aggressive robots by carefully sneaking behind them. Thus, players should not have the ability to teleport. (Noted that in some other games like Budget Cuts, teleport movement works great with the stealth element. However, it is achieved by some very specific mechanics that we are not planning to adopt in our game.)

Arm-swing movement (Figure 1) was chosen since it was more suitable for the scale and pace of the game. Instead of moving his legs, the player only swings his arms to move forward as if he is swimming. The advantage of this movement method is that it is both continuous and not sickness-inducing.

Climbing movement (Figure 2) was then implemented as part of the interaction mechanics. This is also a very effective VR gameplay elements since it introduces challenges in the navigation and rewards the player with a new scenery.

Simulating player’s body physics was one of the challenges I was faced with. A collider is attached to the player’s avatar to simulate the collision between the player’s body and level geometry, as well as to detect gravity and step height when the player uses the stairs or elevator. However, when the player’s VR headset moves to an offset from his original position (starting point) in the real world, the collider will have the same offset. The solution to this problem is whenever the player presses the grab button, the collider will be reset to the player’s head camera position.

A player will die if he fell from a high altitude or is attacked by an enemy. The falling death is detected by the velocity of the player’s fall when he is hitting the ground or in mid-air. The latter is to deal with the situation when the player accidentally fell out of the map and kept falling without hitting anything. In that situation when the player’s speed is over 5 meters per second, he will be forced to respawn. The normal situation is if the player hits the ground at a vertical speed of over 3 meters per second, he is dead. When the player dies, the screen will fade to black and the player will be immediately respawned to the last checkpoint.

### Artificial Intelligence

The balance of AI’s intelligence and playability was explored in our game. The intelligence of AI refers to how it can be aware of the surroundings, detect anomalies and try to search for the player without “cheating.” On the other hand, the playability of AI means it should follow a certain predictable pattern so that the player is able to formulate a strategy against the AI.

The perception system describes the sight and hearing capabilities of an AI character. The sight is described by sight radius, lose sight radius, peripheral vision angle, auto success ranges from last seen location and max-age. Adjusting these parameters will affect the AI character’s alertness and memory. The hearing system is implemented manually. When a certain object hits the ground, the hit location is registered into the list of noise locations. If any noise in this list is within range of the AI character’s hearing range, it will trigger the alert event.

### Conclusion

In the project, different methods of locomotion were implemented and tested. In particular, arm-swing and climbing locomotions were fully implemented and working well in all the game levels. The internal logic for getting the controller’s input was figured out, and a complete and extendible system of object interaction was developed. A temporary solution for body physics was created for the player’s avatar. As for the AI development, an agent with 5 different states (patrolling, alerted, searching, chasing and dead) was implemented through the behaviour tree. With the level design, players could play with different tactics to “outsmart” the robots.

Based on the feedback given, it proves that climbing is a very effective mechanics in an adventure VR game, since it provides both the challenge and satisfaction. Besides, certain visual effects based on the environment or player’s action are interesting, such as the immediate explosion after the player has grabbed the energy box at the back of the AI character, and the change of visual when the player takes the elevator descending to the underground.
