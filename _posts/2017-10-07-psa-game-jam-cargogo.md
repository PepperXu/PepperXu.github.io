### My Role
Game Designer, Programmer, Artist, 3D Modeling, Animation, Sound Effects...

### Duration
One month

This is made for PSA-GameIT competition, in which we were asked to make games promoting their company’s tran-shipment services. Moreover, it has one personal meaning for me: It is the first video game I have ever made. I really enjoy the process of making it, working with people and even stay up all night before the deadline. Years later, if I was lucky enough to get my position in the game industry, I wouldn’t forget it was this simple little game that got all things to start.
